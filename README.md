# World Quant Applied Data Science Lab

Throughout the program, I worked and will work on various projects, which I will document my learning and growth here in this repo. Each project is designed to enhance my understanding and practical application of key data science concepts. The following is a brief explanation of each project:


1- Predicting Apartment Prices in Mexico City: I built a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Mexico City. I created a data pipeline to impute missing values and encode categorical features, and they improve model performance by reducing overfitting.

New Concepts Learned:
- How to create a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.
- How to build a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
- How to improve model performance by reducing overfitting.


2- Air Quality in Dar es Salaam: I built an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Dar es Salaam. I extracted data from a MongoDB database using Pymongo, and improved model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

New Concepts Learned:
- How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.
- How to prepare time series data for analysis.
- How to build an autoregression model.
- How to improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.


3- Earthquakes and Building Damage in Kavrepalanchok: I built  logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings. I extracted data from an SQLite database and revealed the biases in data that can lead to discrimination.

New Concepts Learned:
- How to query a SQL database.
- How to build a logistic regression model for classification.
- How to build a decision tree model.
- How to incorporate ethical considerations into model building.

4- Bankruptcy in Taiwan

New Concepted Learned: I examined financial indicators from Taiwan, and built a model that predicts whether a company will go bankrupt or not.

New Concepts Learned:
- Navigate a file system from the Linux command line.
- Address imbalanced data using resampling techniques.
- Evaluate a model using classification metrics like precision and recall.
